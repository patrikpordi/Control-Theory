To run the simulations go to the files and run the Controller_for_both.m file to initialize the workspace in Matlab.
The corresponding Simulink models can be found in PID and SMC, open them and run them, and the required figures can be opened as well.
Since the PID and PD simulations did not provide significant differences the integrator gains are set to zero,
you can edit them in the corresponding PID blocks.
